# CS-250-Portfolio

This repo contains my assignments from CS-250, my Sprint Review, and my Retrospective. I added at the end of this some miscellaneous thoughts about what particularly stood out from the class.

One of the primary things that stood out was the importance of thinking from the user's perspective. Early on, I'd find myself thinking about just the code or the technical issue, but Agile encouraged me to consider, "What do the user absolutely need this to do?" The process of writing user stories in simple language helped me stay focused and reminded me that the ultimate objective is fixing the user's issue, not simply coming up with code that works.

I also learned just how much simpler things become with work divided into small, gradual steps. Working incrementally, instead of holding it all together at the end, made such a huge impact. The use of sprints, cleaning up the backlog, and constant reviewing of progress allowed me to be focused and make swift changes when something was not going right.

Another big lesson was about teamwork. Programming by oneself might get lonely, but pair programming, backlog refinement, and feedback sessions taught me just how much stronger the team is with everyone's contribution. Being a great teammate, to me, means being open, wanting to contribute, and making sure nobody ends up alone working solo.

In retrospect, CS-250 provided me with a solid introduction to Agile. I recognize how easily I see myself applying these principles (acting from the perspective of the end-user, dividing work, and relying on team effort) into my next assignments.
